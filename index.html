      <h3>Untitled</h3>
      <p>
       The moon shone on the room,<br>
       The room we’d shared.<br>
       Our memories replaying inside,<br>
       As if time had stopped within.<br>
       I stay there when I want to feel you,<br>
       Because time hasn’t been good to us.<br>
       Seeing you in our room,<br>
       When you’re not there.<br>
       Your smile and your voice, <br>
       It’s as if you’re with me.<br>
       But when I leave the room,<br>
       I’m faced with reality.<br>
       The reality that you’re no longer here,<br>
       I’ll never come to terms with it.<br>
       But if i do…<br>
       Perhaps the room will stay the same.<br>
       Housing our memories,<br>
       Keeping them safe.</p>

      <h3>Ghost</h3>
      <p>
       I started smoking—when I’m stressed,<br>
       It makes me feel closer to you—the brand you always used.<br>
       It’s not good for me—I know—don’t tell mum,<br>
       But the smell—brings me back—to my childhood. 
       <br><br>
       The taste—bitter on my tongue,<br>
       Burning my throat.<br>
       Making it feel more—like a chore,<br>
       But—what can I do—I can’t let go.
       <br><br>
       The way I searched through your closet,<br>
       For that coat—the one you always used to wear.<br>
       It feels like a hug,<br>
       But—I know—it could never really be the same.
       <br><br>
       I’m scared—I’ll forget,<br>
       No longer—your little girl.<br>
       You didn’t write me nearly enough<br>
       And I think—I’m forgetting—your voice.
       <br><br>
       It feels—like you’re slipping further away,<br>
       Mum’s perfume—all used up.<br>
       I kept the bottle,<br>
       But what happens when it loses its smell too?
       <br><br>
       I found her recipes—the ones she used to make us,<br>
       But really—I can’t make them taste the same.<br>
       If I delude myself—it’s almost like you’re here,<br>
       But only the ghost—of your ghost.</p>

      <h3>Expired</h3>
      <p>
       When’d you last stay the night?<br>
       I don’t even want to guess.<br>
       Though it doesn’t stop me hoping,<br>
       Buying enough groceries for two—like that would make you stay.
       <br><br>
       If gestures could move you,<br>
       You’d be in my arms already.<br>
       Watching—waiting—as the groceries go off,<br>
       In a home that only hears the voice of one.
       <br><br>
       I remember waking up to you,<br>
       In our bathroom—smiling—as you shaved.<br>
       Why does it feel—like a lifetime of loss,<br>
       Is replacing all of the happiness I once held?
       <br><br>
       Your shaving cream,<br>
       Half full.<br>
       For how long?<br>
       It’s well past the ‘use by’ date.
       <br><br>
       I don’t want to call this relationship—dragged on,<br>
       My heart betraying the pain felt—whenever I see your face.<br>
       No longer smiling—not for me,<br>
       And yet—freshly shaven still.
       <br><br>
       You know—that I know,<br>
       So why can we never acknowledge it with words?<br>
       This relationship,<br>
       It’s long since expired.</p>
