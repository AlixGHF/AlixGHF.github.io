Written: 16/06/2022<br>
Theme: grief, loss, memory, nostalgia
</p>

<p>
The moon shone on the room,<br>
The room we’d shared.<br>
Our memories replaying inside,<br>
As if time had stopped within.<br>
I stay there when I want to feel you,<br>
Because time hasn’t been good to us.<br>
Seeing you in our room,<br>
When you’re not there.<br>
Your smile and your voice, <br>
It’s as if you’re with me.<br>
But when I leave the room,<br>
I’m faced with reality.<br>
The reality that you’re no longer here,<br>
I’ll never come to terms with it.<br>
But if i do…<br>
Perhaps the room will stay the same.<br>
Housing our memories,<br>
Keeping them safe.
