Written: 16/06/2022<br>
Theme: grief, loss, memory, nostalgia
</p>

<p>
The moon shone on the room,<br>
The room we’d shared.<br>
Our memories replaying inside,<br>
As if time had stopped within.<br>
I stay there when I want to feel you,<br>
Because time hasn’t been good to us.<br>
Seeing you in our room,<br>
When you’re not there.<br>
Your smile and your voice, <br>
It’s as if you’re with me.<br>
But when I leave the room,<br>
I’m faced with reality.<br>
The reality that you’re no longer here,<br>
I’ll never come to terms with it.<br>
But if i do…<br>
Perhaps the room will stay the same.<br>
Housing our memories,<br>
Keeping them safe.

Notes: This is my favourite out of all the pieces I've ever written, so I wanted to post it on my birthday. I'm 18 now. I wrote this piece when I was 14, very close to being 15—oh how time passes us by.
I didn't at the time-this piece was written from a flicker of inspiration over a poem we read in my
GCSE English literature class about a room, I think some aspect of it was romantic/ longing.
This was my take on that poem, this is how l imagined that room—however, I feel so much more connected to this poem now that I'm facing university. I feel like I'm leaving all of my childhood memories behind. Like I'm leaving her behind in that room.
As I grow older I become more and more nostalgic. I was never good with loss and it feels like I don't ever want anything to change, well just the small things. I hope things remain unchanged, but more than that, I hope happiness finds me—so much that I struggle to breathe—and those that I love find happiness. I hope that I can be like that to those that I love. 
I thought for a bit over whether I should think of a title for this piece, I never made a title for any of my poetry from 2022/23, but I think there's beauty in complete incompletion, and so I think I'll leave it empty.
