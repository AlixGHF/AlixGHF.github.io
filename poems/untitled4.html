Theme: quiet heartbreak, toxic love, unspoken pain, relationship grief
</p>

<p>
Looking at your back,<br>
Watching you leave.<br>
Hearing your excuses —your sweet nothings,<br>
My heart feels full-but only with ache.<br>
The meaning's gone,<br>
Only empty words remain.<br>
I pick up the broken pieces each time,<br>
Maybe I feel comfort in the pain.<br>
Perhaps I'll become another broken toy,<br>
That you'll end up throwing away.<br>
But before that happens,<br>
Tell me you need me-one more time.
</p>

Notes: I changed it quite a lot but I think the original intent remains, I hope it reads well, I didn't want to change the original wording too much, so if it doesn't come off too well I hope it's forgivable lol
