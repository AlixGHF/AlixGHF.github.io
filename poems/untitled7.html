11:59PM,<br>
But where are you?<br>
Said you’d be out an hour,<br>
And yet now it’s been six.<br>
Sworn he was just a friend,<br>
But of course I know.<br>
Deluding myself,<br>
Because you don’t care enough to make excuses.<br>
Perhaps I’m holding onto that shred of hope,<br>
The light that used to gleam in your eyes.<br>
The light you had when you looked at me,<br>
How you now look at him.<br>
This is an unhealthy game,<br>
I’m playing against myself.<br>
Falling deeper into despair,<br>
Perhaps it’s become a comforting feeling.<br>
Maybe I’ll gather the courage though,<br>
If you hold my hand one last time.<br>
Show me that feeling,<br>
Of your ice cold hand.<br>
As cold as your heart,<br>
As frozen as our once passionate blaze.<br>
If the frost doesn’t kill me,<br>
That stone hard gaze of yours surely will.<br>
Although perhaps I’ve grown to like it,<br>
The way you treat me.<br>
Even if I haven’t,<br>
I’m not sure I could live without it anymore.<br>
So if you don’t mind,<br>
Let me hold onto you.<br>
Reliving the warm memories we once shared,<br>
Living through the pain of your indifferent touch.<br>
Perhaps your presence is enough,<br>
To bring meaning to my life.<br>
Even when you couldn’t care less for that,<br>
Couldn’t care less for me.<br>
So look at me,<br>
Please, before I do something I shouldn’t.<br>
Delude me, how I delude myself,<br>
It’s not easy on my own.<br>
Make me feel like we’re in this together,<br>
One last time.

Notes: "Is this the promised end?" - King Lear.
This is the unpolished, original version of the poem, so I hope it can be overlooked if it's not up to par, I think there's a sort of emotional rawness in this poem in its full, unedited state
