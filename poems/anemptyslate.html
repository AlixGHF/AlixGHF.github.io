Theme: quiet heartbreak, love and loss, second chances, unspoken pain, relationship grief
</p>

<p>
I gave you another chance,<br>
Said we'd start off with an empty slate.<br>
You smiled -lovingly,<br>
I took it as a yes.
<br><br>
Your behaviour didn't change,<br>
It was still the same.<br>
The same hurtful words,<br>
The same broken home.
<br><br>
After all this,<br>
I told you we were done.<br>
But you pleaded-again,<br>
For one final chance.
<br><br>
Those eyes -the ones I lose myself in,<br>
Stopped me from saying no.<br>
I offered my heart once more,<br>
After collecting the pieces.
<br><br>
But once again,<br>
You treated it without care.<br>
The same cycle,<br>
Only ever repeating.
<br><br>
I came to realise,<br>
After so long,<br>
An empty slate,<br>
That's all our relationship was.
