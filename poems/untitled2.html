Written: 29/08/2022<br>
Theme: quiet heartbreak, emotional betrayal, unspoken pain, relationship grief
</p>

<p>
The spark we once had,<br>
Which warmed my very soul.<br>
Has faded to embers,<br>
Nothing left but that bitter loneliness.<br>
You're just out of reach,<br>
But that's alright.<br>
Because from the start-| knew,<br>
It wouldn't last.<br>
For this love-was never enough,<br>
For the three of us.
</p>

Notes: A poem from 2022, the revisions are quite drastic for some of these older pieces, I really do hope they come off well still
