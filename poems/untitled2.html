Theme: quiet heartbreak, past regrets, unspoken pain, relationship grief
</p>

<p>
I miss those times,<br>
When we were just ourselves.<br>
We said we'd run away,<br>
Enjoy our lives together.<br>
I declined,<br>
Knowing it wasn't good for you.<br>
Perhaps if I'd agreed,<br>
We wouldn't have turned out like this.<br>
Unlovingly pushed,<br>
To meet unrealistic expectations.
</p>

Notes: something I wrote in 2022 and edited recently, it's funny how things can change and yet still stay the same. I'm not the same person as back then and yet my writing quirks have stayed relatively the same.
