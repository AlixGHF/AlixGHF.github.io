Theme: romantic, unsaid thoughts, longing, love poem
</p>

<p>
A love letter to you,<br>
You, you, the wonderful you.<br>
You, who my thoughts are consumed,<br>
As if nothing else were to exist.
<br><br>
Looking at you—a door,<br>
A gateway—to depths no other.<br>
Losing myself,<br>
Through you—no danger.<br>
For what is danger,<br>
Myself invited?<br>
As long as it’s you,<br>
Us—yours.
<br><br>
And yet,<br>
It almost feels like a dream.<br>
Where I wish,<br>
That I’d never fallen asleep in the first place.
<br><br>
That feeling—of incomplete completeness,<br>
Because I know—that you won’t feel the same.<br>
And yet I still feel,<br>
Like nothing could matter less.<br>
So what could I be,<br>
If not yours.
<br><br>
Yours—like a summers’ day,<br>
That breeze—21 degrees—your favourite. <br>
Like a winter’s eve,<br>
In blankets—swaddled together—warm. 
<br><br>
Akin to late nights—drinking,<br>
Tipsy—that feeling of mellowness—with you. <br>
But nothing—to the kiss from your lips,<br>
Nothing—comparable. 
<br><br>
So when I’m asked,<br>
Even if not official.<br>
What could I be,<br>
If not yours?

Notes: This was my first attempt at getting back into poetry in years, it's also the piece that let me break away from the rigid rules I stuck myself to. 
As as you can see, technically this piece does follow a pattern; 2,4,2,3,2,2,2
