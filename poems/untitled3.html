Written: 22/07/2022<br>
Revised: 01/06/2025<br>
Theme: quiet heartbreak, love and loss, unspoken pain, relationship grief
</p>

<p>
Looking into your eyes,<br>
I no longer feel the same.<br>
That joy and fullness I once felt,<br>
Now only feels like empty fulfilment.<br>
Being with you and being without you,<br>
I feel empty all the same.
</p>

Notes: Another poem from the past, my older pieces seem to circle mostly around heartbreak. Considering they were all characters and I hadn't been going through any romantic distress this is a bit strange lol
