Written: 15/07/2025<br>
Theme: loss of parents, grief, nostalgia, memory
</p>

<p>
I started smoking—when I’m stressed,<br>
It makes me feel closer to you—the brand you always used.<br>
It’s not good for me—I know—don’t tell mum,<br>
But the smell—brings me back—to my childhood. 
<br><br>
The taste—bitter on my tongue,<br>
Burning my throat.<br>
Making it feel more—like a chore,<br>
But—what can I do—I can’t let go.
<br><br>
The way I searched through your closet,<br>
For that coat—the one you always used to wear.<br>
It feels like a hug,<br>
But—I know—it could never really be the same.
<br><br>
I’m scared—I’ll forget,<br>
No longer—your little girl.<br>
You didn’t write me nearly enough<br>
And I think—I’m forgetting—your voice.
<br><br>
It feels—like you’re slipping further away,<br>
Mum’s perfume—all used up.<br>
I kept the bottle,<br>
But what happens when it loses its smell too?
<br><br>
I found her recipes—the ones she used to make us,<br>
But really—I can’t make them taste the same.<br>
If I delude myself—it’s almost like you’re here,<br>
But only the ghost—of your ghost.

Notes: looking back I did use far too many em dashes Imao, I can't really help it though, that's how it's meant to be read
hopefully that doesn't affect the reading for reader's and it still comes off well
I was sent an inspiration post by a friend (1 may have sort of ignored the post and taken a bit of a different direction than the post intended) and this is the general idea that I took from it
