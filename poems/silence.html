Theme: emotional distance, love and loss, silence, unspoken words, longing, intimate writing
</p>

<p>
Nothing,<br>
Just silence.<br>
So why—does it feel,<br>
Like my heart—is jumping—out of my chest.
<br><br>
My breath—shallow,<br>
Laboured.<br>
Like the walls—of this lonely home,<br>
Were closing in.
<br><br>
And I know…<br>
I don’t want to.<br>
And it feels—as though I shouldn’t,<br>
And yet—how can I help—that I do?
<br><br>
My heart so full—yet empty,<br>
Of things I can’t bear to name.<br>
But—I think—I’ll miss it when it’s gone,<br>
The pain—the heartache—so familiar.
<br><br>
Losing you—I fear—is losing myself,<br>
But what—can I offer but silence—to your silence.<br>
I’m sure if you dig—you’ll find something of value,<br>
So—God—let me be worth the effort.

Notes: This is the most personal I've ever gotten with poetry, it's a personal piece. Anyway, I hope this can resonate.
