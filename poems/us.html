Written: 14/06/2025<br>
Theme: quiet heartbreak, past regrets, unspoken pain, relationship grief
</p>

<p>
Romance is a test,<br>
Love a battle.<br>
To have something of value,<br>
You have to prove it worthwhile.
<br><br>
So of course—hardships, <br>
Should hold no bearing—over us.<br>
Us—together a team,<br>
Isn’t that how it’s meant to be?
<br><br>
Instead we argue,<br>
Shouting as though it’s second nature.<br>
I look into your eyes for the answer,<br>
How did we—fall into this?
<br><br>
Your eyes offer no response,<br>
I’ve long since lost you.<br>
No longer able,<br>
Unable to read each other.
<br><br>
Maybe each other is all there is,<br>
I feel like a stranger.<br>
Once able to find myself through you,<br>
Looking now feels foreign.
<br><br>
I look at you and think,<br>
Is this not worth fighting for?<br>
But more than that, maybe…<br>
Loving you is a fight, one that I want to lose.

Notes: This was my first attempt at getting back into poetry in years, it was also my first attempt at a romantic piece, a challenge to see if I was apt enough. It still ended up as angst lol
