Written: 14/07/2025<br>
Theme: love and loss, grief, nostalgia, memory, emotional decay
</p>

<p>
When’d you last stay the night?<br>
I don’t even want to guess.<br>
Though it doesn’t stop me hoping,<br>
Buying enough groceries for two—like that would make you stay.
<br><br>
If gestures could move you,<br>
You’d be in my arms already.<br>
Watching—waiting—as the groceries go off,<br>
In a home that only hears the voice of one.
<br><br>
I remember waking up to you,<br>
In our bathroom—smiling—as you shaved.<br>
Why does it feel—like a lifetime of loss,<br>
Is replacing all of the happiness I once held?
<br><br>
Your shaving cream,<br>
Half full.<br>
For how long?<br>
It’s well past the ‘use by’ date.
<br><br>
I don’t want to call this relationship—dragged on,<br>
My heart betraying the pain felt—whenever I see your face.<br>
No longer smiling—not for me,<br>
And yet—freshly shaven still.
<br><br>
You know—that I know,<br>
So why can we never acknowledge it with words?<br>
This relationship,<br>
It’s long since expired.
</p>

<div class="notes">
Notes: My friend gave me the prompt shaving cream. I love how everyday objects can be used to symbolise such a depth of emotion, and I hope I captured that level of emotional vulnerability with my imagery.
I also love the use of cyclical poetry and recurring themes, so I hope that was well executed as well.
